* Tab trainning
    - Thread created
    - all function missing
    - all set and get data to/from GUI objects

* Tab predict
    - Save the forcasted picture too

    I was adding forcast creation data to table DB 

* Too complicate to added or delete columns in DB, change list queries for dictionary, 
in this way when I modify db structure, in code the dictionary lables won't changes

* A new global function to update object was create, and of curse some other function were created because of it

*Create a Tab to evaluate forcasting using the forcast_result
